# Apollo's Orchestra

## Description
A music database that provides a rich collection of information, including detailed profiles of artists, albums, singles, and record labels. It also categorizes music by genres, highlights the role of instruments, and features an extensive archive of songs and recordings.

## Motivation
First and foremost, we are big fans of music in its various forms. We believe that the intricacies and diverse ways to classify music will allow for an interesting project with varied data sets. The notion of integrating knowledge into a database so that people can better find music they are interested in sounds very promising. Users will be able to search for music by instruments, genre, and other metrics to obtain relevant results. With this model, we also hope to implement a prediction system to provide better recommendations for new and interesting music.

## Identified data and knowledge sources
- **Music Brainz**: Extensive Music database with many bands, labels, people of interest and their relationships with each other
- **WikiData**: For relevant music genres, popular bands and artists and events
- **Discogs**: Like Music Brainz, has a lot of information about artists, genres and music releases. It includes information on various formats, labels, and contributions from artists and collectors, making it a rich source of music-related data.
- **Last.fm**: This platform tracks music listening habits and provides recommendations based on user preferences. Its API allows access to a wealth of data about artists, albums, and tracks.
- **Genius**: A database of song lyrics and annotations. Genius also includes information about artists and songs, providing insights into lyrics and their meanings.
- **AcousticBrainz**: A project that provides a large database of music analysis data, including features like tempo, key, and mood, useful for music recommendation systems.

## Anticipated Challenges
- **Ensuring data quality and consistency**: Since we will need various sources for our data, some effort will have to had to ensure that all data is of good quality, is consistent and is interoptable.
- **Data Linking**: Some relationships, like music <-> artist, should be straightforward. Others, however, like music <-> instrument, might prove more challenging.
- **Integration with existing platforms**: Limitations of our data sources might get in the way. Limitations like API request limits and free tiers might necessitate the search for alternatives or workarounds.
- **Prediction System**: Create an accurate and usefull prediction system with the data collected and the relations between it.
